# Project Overview
National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is an Indian social welfare government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed wage employment opportunities. It aims to enhance livelihood security in rural areas by providing at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to at least one member of every household whose
adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work.The objective of this project analysis is to gain valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts in India which willhelp guide policymakers for scheme optimization.



## Data Source
"NREGA.csv file format [Uploading NREGA.csv…]()
This Dataset was provided by Mentoreness as part of my project work as a data analyst intern at mentoreness.
This Dataset consists of 1 tables 

## Skills
-  Power Query for Data Preproccessing
-  Power BI for EDA and Visualization

 ## Data Preproccessing
The dataset used for this analysis consists of a wide range of variables, including the number of job cards issued, the workforce engaged, budget allocation, work completion statistics, Wages paid, Expenditure, etc. 
- The data contains 28 columns and 740 rows.
- There are no duplicates or null values in the dataset
- Data Validation for all the columns to ensure consistency 
- The column names were renamed for better readability and accuracy.


## Problem Statement
NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address several key questions and challenges associated with NREGA:
- How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
- Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
- What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with employment generation?
- What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there any roadblocks to its success?
- Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the scheme's impact?

## Findings 
- There are 34 states and 736 districts.
- Andhra Pradesh (216M), Uttar Pradesh(210M), and Madhya Pradesh (200M) are the top 3 states with the highest approved labor budget while Goa (100K), Lakshadweep (10K), and West Bengal  with zero  budget allocation are states with the least approved budget.
- The results from the analysis conducted on NREGA dataset indicates disparities among various states. E.g. West Bengal is among the top state with the highest number of active workers, and active job cards but yet had no budget allocation for the region.
- The Most performing states with all factors considered are Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu.
- The Least performing states with all factors considered are Goa, Lakshadweep, and Dn Haveli and Dp.
- Tamil Nadu (99k), Andhra Pradesh (75k), Telangana (39K) have the highest count of differently abled persons who participated in NREGA works.
- 22% of works were successfully completed while 78% of works are currently still in progress.
-  Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand,  and Karnataka have the highest count of completed works. However, Uttar Pradesh  has the most number of works currently in progress.
- The total number of works initiated, both new project and spill over is 17M compared to total works completed which is about 3.7M.
- ST and SC Workers have fewer representation and participation among active workers, only 12% are scheduled tribe workers and 15% are scheduled caste workers among 73% of other active workers.

## Recommendation
-  Although NREGA has been effective in providing employment opportunities across states in India, regional variation exists in the implementation and outcome of the scheme, with some regions experiencing greater benefits than others. Policymakers need to address this issue and optimize resource allocation across regions, which will help improve the impact of the scheme.
-  NREGA initiative involves promoting sustainable development and empowering rural households, however, there are some roadblocks, such as insufficient budget allocation and administrative issues, that may hinder the success of this scheme. Management should ensure tackling these constraints by ensuring moderate to high variability in community participation, an adequate wage rate, infrastructure development, and inclusivity.
